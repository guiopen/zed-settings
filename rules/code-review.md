Perform a thorough code review of the staged changes following the steps below:
1 - Run ´git diff --staged --name-only´ to get the list of modified files.
2 - Run ´git diff --staged´ to understand exactly what lines were added, modified, or removed.
3 - Read the full current content of those specific files, alongside any related files if necessary to understand the broader context of the changes.
4 - Provide a code review focusing on bugs and best practices, considering the entire file state, not just the diff.
